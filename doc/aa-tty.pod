=head1 NAME

aa-tty - Prints the device name of the active tty

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<aa-tty> [B<-D>] [B<-O> I<FILE|FD>]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-D, --double-output>

Enable double-output mode. Instead of using stdout for regular output, and
stderr for warnings and errors, everything is sent both to stdout and stderr.
This is intended to redirect stderr to a log file, so full output can be both
shown on console and logged.

B<Deprecation warning:> Note that this option has been deprecated and will be
removed in the next version; You should use B<--log-file> instead.

=item B<-h, --help>

Show help screen and exit.

=item B<-O, --log-file> I<FILE|FD>

Will duplicate all output (everything written to stdout or stderr) to the given
file or file descriptor. I<FILE|FD> can either be a (previously opened for
writing) file descriptor (must be > 2), or a file which will then be opened in
append mode.

=item B<-V, --version>

Show version information and exit.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<aa-tty>(1) is a small tool that will print to device name of the active tty.
It determines it by reading I<active> files in I</sys/class/tty> starting with
I</sys/class/tty/console/active> and "going up" as much as possible.

# 2015-08-10, v0.2.0

 +  Add aa-tty, small tool to print the device name of the active tty

 +  Add aa-ctty, small execline helper to set controlling terminal

 +  stage{0,2,3}: Set controlling terminal (to use ^C)
    That way one can use Ctrl+C on aa-st{art,op} to manually timeout a pending
    service.

!!! Use /etc/anopa/listdirs/onboot instead of /etc/anopa/onboot

 !  status: Rename -l to -L for --list
    (Because we'll want to use -l for --listdir, for consistency.)

 +  stop/status/enable: Add --listdir

 +  --listdir supports auto-prefix; That is, unless it starts with a slash or
    dot, it gets auto-prefixed with "/etc/anopa/listdirs/"

+++ status: Add --filter

 !  start/enable: Rename -n/-w to -N/-W

+++ start/stop/status/enable: Add --dry-list (-n)

+++ stop: Process "needs" in reverse order. We used to only stop whatever was
    specified, processing dependencies ("needs") only as ordering directives
    (i.e.  as "after"), which obviously isn't right.

    Now they're correctly processed "in reverse," i.e. if A needs B then we'll
    set it as B needs A, i.e. to stop B we also need to stop A (and the
    matching "after" will be there to order stopping A before B).

+++ start/stop/enable/status/reset: Support reading from stdin
    Use "-" as service name on the command line to read them (one per line)
    from stdin.
    Useful to read them from a file, or pipe a --dry-list output.

 +  enable: Add --upgrade to upgrade servicedirs

 +  Support --double-output about everywhere

+++ Make compatible/require s6 v2.2.0.0
    Event for "unready" in aa-setready is now 'N' (was 'D'), as is the short
    option for --unready

 !  Plus a few fixes; see git log for details

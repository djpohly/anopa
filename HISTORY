# 2015-11-14, v0.3.0

 +  start/stop: Don't need root rights for --dry-list

 !  tty: Fix possibly printing garbage; Thanks to John O'Meara

+++ Add helper command, to easily get clean environment & logged output

+++ enable: Create "supervise" folders w/ perms 0711 - This allows to read the
    s6 status file even as a user, the file itself being world-readble. Allows
    e.g. proper/full use of aa-status as a user.
    One can use --no-supervise to disable it.

 +  shutdown: Check argv[0] for use via symlinks, so one can use symlinks
    "halt", "reboot" and "poweroff" to use this.
    Can help make things easier, and more "compatible" with sysvinit.

 !  Fix not always reporting an error when loading a service
    This could manifest e.g. when aa-status couldn't read the s6 status file
    (permission denied), and would just silently ignore the error/service.

+++ status: Add --sort (also --name & --reverse); Services are now sorted by
    time by default.

!!! enable: Fix deleting "log" with --upgrade; When clearing the servicedir
    during an upgrade, the folder "log" (i.e. the logger) was removed; It is now
    properly treated.

+++ Add (better) support of loggers. Now */log servicedirs are processed as
    regular servicedirs, supporting dependencies and such. Additionally, any
    longrun with a logger will have a dependency ("needs") on said logger
    auto-added.

    Before, they were autostarted by s6-svscan (no down file was set) and
    expected to always be up. They're now processed as usual, so starting foobar
    will first need to start foobar/log as expected.

    aa-status has more filters to deal with loggers properly.

 *  enable: Count loggers as well

*** enable: Print enabled services; Add --quiet not to

 +  start/stop: Add --verbose

 !  start: Fix handling already up but not ready services
    If a service that supports readiness was already up but not yet ready, it
    would be "ignored" (as "Already up"). We now properly include it in the
    "transaction" and wait for it to become ready; "Already up" only applying
    when ready.

+++ Bump build requirement to skalibs 2.3.8.0

 !  Plus a few (other) fixes; see git log for details


# 2015-08-10, v0.2.0

 +  Add aa-tty, small tool to print the device name of the active tty

 +  Add aa-ctty, small execline helper to set controlling terminal

 +  stage{0,2,3}: Set controlling terminal (to use ^C)
    That way one can use Ctrl+C on aa-st{art,op} to manually timeout a pending
    service.

!!! Use /etc/anopa/listdirs/onboot instead of /etc/anopa/onboot

 !  status: Rename -l to -L for --list
    (Because we'll want to use -l for --listdir, for consistency.)

 +  stop/status/enable: Add --listdir

 +  --listdir supports auto-prefix; That is, unless it starts with a slash or
    dot, it gets auto-prefixed with "/etc/anopa/listdirs/"

+++ status: Add --filter

 !  start/enable: Rename -n/-w to -N/-W

+++ start/stop/status/enable: Add --dry-list (-n)

+++ stop: Process "needs" in reverse order. We used to only stop whatever was
    specified, processing dependencies ("needs") only as ordering directives
    (i.e.  as "after"), which obviously isn't right.

    Now they're correctly processed "in reverse," i.e. if A needs B then we'll
    set it as B needs A, i.e. to stop B we also need to stop A (and the
    matching "after" will be there to order stopping A before B).

+++ start/stop/enable/status/reset: Support reading from stdin
    Use "-" as service name on the command line to read them (one per line)
    from stdin.
    Useful to read them from a file, or pipe a --dry-list output.

 +  enable: Add --upgrade to upgrade servicedirs

 +  Support --double-output about everywhere

+++ Make compatible/require s6 v2.2.0.0
    Event for "unready" in aa-setready is now 'N' (was 'D'), as is the short
    option for --unready

 !  Plus a few fixes; see git log for details


# 2015-04-10, v0.1.0

 *  first alpha release
